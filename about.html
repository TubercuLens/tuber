            <p>This is a prototype.</p>

            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>This web app uses computer vision to detect tuberculosis (TB) on chest x-rays. Today there's still no quick test for TB like there is for Malaria and HIV. This is a step towards creating a test that can quickly identify whether or not a person is infected.</p>

            <h2>Image Format</h2>
            <p>The app accepts images in jpg or png format.</p>
        </section>

            <h2>Limitations</h2>
            <p>The Ai brain (model) that powers the app was trained using only 800 x-rays. This is a very small dataset by deep learning standards. Therefore, even though the scores during testing are reasonably good, I'm not sure how well this model will perform under real-world conditions.

                Also, the prediction accuracy could be affected by factors like x-ray machine type, varying image lighting conditions, damaged x-ray images (e.g. pen marks) and other factors.</p>

            <h2>Dataset Licence</h2>
            <p>
                I could not find the explicit licencing conditions for the data that was used to train this model. I'm therefore assuming that the data ++ licenced for non-commercial, academic research and education use only.
